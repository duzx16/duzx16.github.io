Some algorithms suffer from extrinsic reasons of unfairness due to inherent selection biases in implicit feedback leading to rich-get-richer dynamics. While those that address the biased nature of implicit feedback suffer from intrinsic reasons of unfairness due to the lack of explicit control over the allocation of exposure based on merit (i.e, relevance). In both cases, the learned ranking policy can be unfair and lead to suboptimal results. To this end, we propose a novel learning-to-rank framework, FULTR, that is the first to address both intrinsic and extrinsic reasons of unfairness when learning ranking policies from logged implicit feedback. Considering the needs of various applications, we define a class of amortized fairness of exposure constraints with respect to items based on their merit, and propose corresponding counterfactual estimators of disparity (aka unfairness) and utility that are also robust to click noise. Furthermore, we provide an efficient algorithm that optimizes both utility and fairness via a policy-gradient approach. To show that our proposed algorithm learns accurate and fair ranking policies from biased and noisy feedback, we provide empirical results beyond the theoretical justification of the framework.

However, few studies have focused on relation types unseen in the original KG, given only one or a few instances for training. To bridge this gap, we propose CogKR for one-shot KG reasoning. The one-shot relational learning problem is tackled through two modules: the summary module summarizes the underlying relationship of the given instances, based on which the reasoning module infers the correct answers. Motivated by the dual process theory in cognitive science, in the reasoning module, a cognitive graph is built by iteratively coordinating retrieval (System 1, collecting relevant evidence intuitively) and reasoning (System 2, conducting relational reasoning over collected information). The structural information offered by the cognitive graph enables our model to aggregate pieces of evidence from multiple reasoning paths and explain the reasoning process graphically. Experiments show that CogKR substantially outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on one-shot KG reasoning benchmarks, with relative improvements of 24.3%-29.7% on MRR.","tags":null,"title":"Cognitive Knowledge Graph Reasoning for One-shot Relational Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Zhengxiao Du**","Jie Tang","Yuhui Ding"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1569813592,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569813592,"objectID":"0bf068cad51390a710162609fe82a1fb","permalink":"https://duzx16.github.io/publication/tkde-19/","publishdate":"2019-09-30T11:19:52+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/tkde-19/","section":"publication","summary":"We study the problem of personalized article recommendation, in particular when the user’s preference data is missing or limited, which is knowns as the user cold-start issue in recommender systems.

Most existing recommendation algorithms rely on extensive observed data and are brittle to recommendation scenarios with few interactions. This paper addresses such problems using few-shot learning and meta learning. Our approach is based on the insight that having a good generalization from a few examples relies on both a generic model initialization and an effective strategy for adapting this model to newly arising tasks. To accomplish this, we combine the scenario-specific learning with a model-agnostic sequential meta-learning and unify them into an integrated end-toend framework, namely Scenario-specific Sequential Meta learner (or $s^2$ Meta ). By doing so, our meta-learner produces a generic initial model through aggregating contextual information from a variety of prediction tasks while effectively adapting to specific tasks by leveraging learning-to-learn knowledge. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model can achieve significant gains over the state-of-the-arts for cold-start problems in online recommendation.

Given a query, POLAR uses an attention-based CNN to estimate the relevance score between the query and related articles. The attention mechanism can help signiﬁcantly improve the relevance estimation. For example, on AMiner, this can help achieve a +5.0% improvement in terms of NDCG@3. One more challenge in personalized article recommendation is how to collect statistically suﬃcient training data for a recommendation model. POLAR combines a one-shot learning function into the recommendation model, which further gains signiﬁcant improvements. For example, on AMiner, with only 1.6 feedbacks on average, POLAR achieves 2.7% improvement by NDCG@3. We evaluate the proposed POLAR on three diﬀerent datasets: AMiner, Patent, and RARD.
