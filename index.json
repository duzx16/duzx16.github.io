However, few studies have focused on relation types unseen in the original KG, given only one or a few instances for training. To bridge this gap, we propose CogKR for one-shot KG reasoning. The one-shot relational learning problem is tackled through two modules: the summary module summarizes the underlying relationship of the given instances, based on which the reasoning module infers the correct answers. Motivated by the dual process theory in cognitive science, in the reasoning module, a cognitive graph is built by iteratively coordinating retrieval (System 1, collecting relevant evidence intuitively) and reasoning (System 2, conducting relational reasoning over collected information). The structural information offered by the cognitive graph enables our model to aggregate pieces of evidence from multiple reasoning paths and explain the reasoning process graphically. Experiments show that CogKR substantially outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on one-shot KG reasoning benchmarks, with relative improvements of 24.3%-29.7% on MRR.","tags":null,"title":"Cognitive Knowledge Graph Reasoning for One-shot Relational Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yifeng Zhao","Jie Tang","**Zhengxiao Du**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"0289d880c699e53b73f74f6d184dc899","permalink":"/publication/pakdd-19/","publishdate":"2019-07-20T13:59:10.996845Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pakdd-19/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"EFCNN: A Restricted Convolutional Neural Network for Expert Finding","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Zhengxiao Du**","Xiaowei Wang","Hongxia Yang","Jingren Zhou","Jie Tang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"03a2041179dddcfb4791a622e94f5eac","permalink":"/publication/kdd-19/","publishdate":"2019-07-20T13:59:10.997616Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kdd-19/","section":"publication","summary":"Cold-start problems are long-standing challenges for practical recommendations. Most existing recommendation algorithms rely on extensive observed data and are brittle to recommendation scenarios with few interactions. This paper addresses such problems using few-shot learning and meta learning. Our approach is based on the insight that having a good generalization from a few examples relies on both a generic model initialization and an effective strategy for adapting this model to newly arising tasks. To accomplish this, we combine the scenario-specific learning with a model-agnostic sequential meta-learning and unify them into an integrated end-toend framework, namely Scenario-specific Sequential Meta learner (or $s^2$ Meta ). By doing so, our meta-learner produces a generic initial model through aggregating contextual information from a variety of prediction tasks while effectively adapting to specific tasks by leveraging learning-to-learn knowledge. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model can achieve significant gains over the state-of-the-arts for cold-start problems in online recommendation.

Given a query, POLAR uses an attention-based CNN to estimate the relevance score between the query and related articles. The attention mechanism can help signiﬁcantly improve the relevance estimation. For example, on AMiner, this can help achieve a +5.0% improvement in terms of NDCG@3. One more challenge in personalized article recommendation is how to collect statistically suﬃcient training data for a recommendation model. POLAR combines a one-shot learning function into the recommendation model, which further gains signiﬁcant improvements. For example, on AMiner, with only 1.6 feedbacks on average, POLAR achieves 2.7% improvement by NDCG@3. We evaluate the proposed POLAR on three diﬀerent datasets: AMiner, Patent, and RARD. Experimental results demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of the proposed model. Recently, we have successfully deployed POLAR into AMiner as the recommendation engine for article recommendation, which further conﬁrms the eﬀectiveness of the proposed model.","tags":null,"title":"POLAR: Attention-Based CNN for One-Shot Personalized Article Recommendation","type":"publication"}]
